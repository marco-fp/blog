<p>React Native lets you create mobile applications using the same design as React, with javascript. The result is a native mobile application, identical to one written in Objective-C or Java.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To accomplish this, React Native renders components that translate into native implementations.</p>
<p>In addition, we'll be able to re-use native code whenever we need to, as easily as importing the file and rendering it as a component in our React Native view.<br><br></p>
<hr>
<p>To speed things up, we'll be using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app">create-react-native-app</a>, a library that will let us build an application without any configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Of course, we could set things up manually, but the configuration of things like hot-reloading and optimized builds is out of the scope of this post)</p>
<p>Asuming we already have NPM and Node 6.x installed, follow this steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <em>create-react-native-app</em> globally
<blockquote>$&gt; npm install -g create-react-native-app</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Initialize and setup the foundation of our first application<br>
<blockquote>$&gt; create-react-native-app my-first-app</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Step into the project's directory and run the project
<blockquote>$&gt; cd my-first-app/<br>$&gt; npm start</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point we'll have our application initialized and running and a QR code will be displayed on the terminal.</p>
